> ### Dataset Columns
  1. PassengerId
  2. Survived
  3. Pclass
  4. Name
  5. Sex
  6. Age
  7. SibSp
  8. Parch
  9. Ticket
  10. Fare
  11. Cabin
  12. Embarked

 In this article, we will learn to predict the survival chances of the Titanic passengers using the given information about their sex, age, etc.

> ### Prediction
We are provided with the testing dataset on which we have to perform the prediction. To predict, we will pass the test dataset into our trained model and save it into a CSV file containing the information, passengerid and survival. PassengerId will be the passengerid of the passengers in the test data and the survival will column will be either 0 or 1.
